      <h1>üñ•Ô∏è SysPilot: System Control on Your Local Network</h1>
      <p>
        SysPilot is a local web application designed to give you convenient and
        secure control over your machine, directly from any device on your local
        network. It transforms your browser into a powerful remote control for
        key operating system operations, multimedia management, and basic
        monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built with Python (Flask) on the backend and a modern frontend interface
        (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), SysPilot offers a lightweight and efficient
        solution for <b>Linux users</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
      <p>
        SysPilot is installed as a service on your Linux machine. Once running,
        it deploys a web interface that you can access via any web browser (on a
        computer, tablet, or mobile phone) as long as you are connected to the
        <b>same local network</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not need an external internet connection or cloud services. All
        control is performed privately and securely within your home or office
        network.
      </p>
